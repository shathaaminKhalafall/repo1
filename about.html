                  <h3>Artistoria site idea </h3>
                  <p>In Gaza there are many artists, not famous, so we thought of creating a website that provides artistic services in one place.
                  Its goal is to facilitate access to various services and provide the user with more options. At the same time providing job opportunities for people who have technical services such as painter. And the opportunity for unknown people to become known in the community. .</p>
                  <h3>Join us </h3>
                  <p>It is a page where artists can display their talents, present their work, and see the talents of other artists on our site.
                   About and contact  </p>
